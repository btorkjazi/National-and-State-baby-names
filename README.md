# National-and-State-baby-names
This project includes analyses of two data sets. One is for the census of national baby names and the other one is about census of baby names based on the states. I used the dataset for national and state baby names for the period between 1880-2014 to find various ratios such as the dominant gender and visualize results about the name trends during this period. I also could find the famous names in this period and the states in which they were most popular. I illustrated all the results to better understand the trends and I discussed about the results in my notes between the codes.
